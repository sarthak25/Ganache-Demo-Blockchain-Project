# Ganache-Demo-Blockchain-Project

The project is Ganache. Ethereum smart contracts are programs executed within the context of transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum Ganache forms part of the Truffle Suite, a set of developer tools that allows users to recreate blockchain environments locally and test smart contracts. Smart contract execution on the Ethereum blockchain is very different from other types of software. First of all, the on-chain context makes it hard to communicate with the outside world. Simple input and output operations, such as writing to a console, are not possible, as transactions are the only means of communicating with the blockchain. Secondly, the transactional nature of the blockchain means that all state changing interactions with a smart contract are asynchronous in nature. This means that when transactions are sent, the effects are not visible until the transaction has been confirmed by being included in a block. Finally, the blockchain environment places some specific restrictions on the code that can be executed, mostly related to the cost associated with each operation.
